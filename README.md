# ObieLocal

[**ObieLocal**](http://obielocal.com) is a map interface for Oberlin
College that was designed to allow people to quickly find out what's happening
around campus, when it's happening, and any details that they need so that they
can go experience it.

The majority of events that appear on the site are retrieved from the
[calendar.oberlin.edu](http://calendar.oberlin.edu) API and displayed on
screen. However, individual users are also able to create events that are
added in realtime to the site.

## Features for future implementation

_...in no particular order._

- User accounts
  - Some users have different event creation permissions than others.
  - Users can mark events that they are committing to (think: Facebook).
  - Ability to add events to a user's linked Google Calendar account.
  - Invite other users (via email) to events that you're interested in.
  - "My Events" display for events that a user has committed to. This obviously
    has to carry over from session to session.
- Event filtration
  - Show events that are happening in the future, not just today.
  - Filter by user events, college events, price, etc.
- Smoother event creation
  - Places on campus should appear automatically as you begin typing their
    names. Ultimately, the experience of creating an event should feel
    intuitive and exciting, not painful.
- Mobile friendly
  - The site makes the most sense if it's accessible by a mobile device.
- More robust event details
  - This includes support for pictures, changing backgrounds, anything that
    makes events look more exciting, personalized, and enticing.
- Logo
  - I mean, really, we need a logo.

ObieLocal was developed by Colton Potter, Minh Lam, Thomas Nemeh, and Lukas
Griffin for their Systems Programming class in Fall 2018, and remains in
development. For comments, suggestions (really, we appreciate any
suggestions!), or if you're interested on working on the project, email
[Colton.Potter@oberlin.edu](mailto:colton.potter@oberlin.edu). We had no idea
how to do any web development when we got started, so we're just learning as we
go.
