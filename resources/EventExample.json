Redwood includes a video and cycle of paintings for the interior and exterior of the house.\n\nFrom July 14 through September 30, the Weltzheimer/ Johnson House has extended hours: from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays, and from 1-5 p.m., Sundays. All visits on the regular first Sundays, August 5 and September 2, require advance registration and a $5 admission fee.\n\nThis project was commissioned by FRONT International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art, and organized by Andrea Gyorody, Ellen Johnson ’33 Assistant Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.\n\nRedwood is presented with support from the Eric and  Jane Nord Family Fund and the Nord Family Foundation.",
